# cudaPredatorPrey

This repository contains the CUDA code that runs the model describing spatial self-organisation in a predator-prey system, as published in:

Sherratt, J. A., X. Lambin, C. J. Thomas and T. N. Sherratt (2002). "Generation of periodic waves by landscape features in cyclic predator-prey systems." Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 269(1489): 327-334.

The workings of this CUDA code is explained in the paper:

Johan van de Koppel, Rohit Gupta, and Cornelis Vuik. 2011. "Scaling-up spatially-explicit ecological models using graphics processors." Ecological Modelling 222.17: 3011-3019.

which describes the use use of graphics processors for simulating ecological models (using CUDA) at large spatial scales.

To run this model, read the explanation on the main page https://johanvandekoppel.github.io. You need to have a CUDA-compatible video card, and on a Linux or Mac system, follow the explanation provided under "For Mac or Linux users". If you work under windows, you are unfortunately on your own to conquer "Visual Studio". Visual studio was for me the reason to buy a Macbook ;-).
